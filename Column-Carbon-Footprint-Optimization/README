# Column-Carbon-Footprint-Optimization

# Requirements:
1. OS Windows/Linux/Mac.
2. Anaconda
3. Python>3.8


## How to use?

### 1: Setting working environment
Create an environment in Anaconda with the following command using the env.yaml in the Column-Design-Optimization folder:

conda env create -f env.yaml

### 2: Data generation scripts and their description is provided in the Column-Design-Optimization folder.


### 3: Data pre-processing and network model
- pre-processing_co2.py script contains the data filtration based on monetary cost for the case of 4.0 meters.

- normalization_co2.py script contrains min-max normalization and preparing the data for network.

- net_co2.py file contrains network file for training the network. 

- use column_co2.pth  and test.py files for inference.

- use test_min_co2.h5 and test_max_co2.h5 files for minmax normalization of the test sample before extracting network predictions.

### 4: Design check
Use check_co2.py in the check folder to check of the network output results.
